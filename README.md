# Hi there üëã

**`Software Engineer by ‚òÄÔ∏è, Digital Wizard by üåë`**

I am a software engineer with knowledge in digital art and audio-visuals. I have a passion for creating stuff in the digital realm. Currently, I'm specializing in Go and playing around with infra, looking forward to learning more low-level and systems programming.
